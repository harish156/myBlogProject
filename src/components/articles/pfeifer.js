                   Pfeiffer Beach is a beautiful, unspoiled beach that's popular with locals. It's somewhat unknown among tourists and well worth your time. You'll get eye-popping offshore views of rocks and sea stacks â€” and occasional good surf. This beach also has unusual purple sand.

                 <p>
                    If it weren't for the spectacular scenery, this would be the beach's most significant feature. No one spilled anything purple on the sand, even though it does look like grape-flavored drink mix.
